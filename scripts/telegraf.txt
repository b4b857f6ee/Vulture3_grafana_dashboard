#   ## Files to gather stats about.
#   ## These accept standard unix glob matching rules, but with the addition of
#   ## ** as a "super asterisk". ie:
#   ##   "/var/log/**.log"  -> recursively find all .log files in /var/log
#   ##   "/var/log/*/*.log" -> find all .log files with a parent dir in /var/log
#   ##   "/var/log/apache.log" -> just tail the apache log file
#   ##
#   ## See https://github.com/gobwas/glob for more examples
